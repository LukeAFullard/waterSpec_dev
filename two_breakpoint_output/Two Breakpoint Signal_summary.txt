Segmented Analysis (2 Breakpoints) for: Two Breakpoint Signal
Breakpoint 1 Period ≈ 0.0 days
Breakpoint 2 Period ≈ 0.0 days
-----------------------------------
Segment 1 (Low-Frequency):
  β1 = 1.50 | 🟢 Persistent / Subsurface Dominated (High Persistence)
  Interpretation: 1 < β < 3 (fBm-like): Strong persistence, suggesting transport is damped by storage.
-----------------------------------
Segment 2 (Mid-Frequency):
  β2 = 0.55 | 🟡 Mixed / Weak Persistence
  Interpretation: -0.5 < β < 1 (fGn-like): Weak persistence or anti-persistence, suggesting event-driven transport.
-----------------------------------
Segment 3 (High-Frequency):
  β3 = 2.10 | 🟢 Persistent / Subsurface Dominated (High Persistence)
  Interpretation: β ≈ 2: Brownian noise (random walk).
