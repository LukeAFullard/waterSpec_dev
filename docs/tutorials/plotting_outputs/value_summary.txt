Segmented Analysis for: value
Breakpoint Period ≈ 47.4 days
-----------------------------------
Low-Frequency (Long-term) Fit:
  β1 = -1.66
  Interpretation: Warning: Beta value is significantly negative, which is physically unrealistic.
  Persistence: 🔴 Event-driven (Low Persistence)
-----------------------------------
High-Frequency (Short-term) Fit:
  β2 = 2.35
  Interpretation: 1 < β < 3 (fBm-like): Strong persistence, suggesting transport is damped by storage.
  Persistence: 🟢 Persistent / Subsurface Dominated (High Persistence)
