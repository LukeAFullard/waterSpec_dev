Details for Chosen (Segmented) Model:
Segmented Analysis for: Synthetic Signal
Breakpoint Period ≈ 22.6 days
-----------------------------------
Low-Frequency (Long-term) Fit:
  β1 = 1.34
  Interpretation: 1 < β < 3 (fBm-like): Strong persistence, suggesting transport is damped by storage.
  Persistence: 🟢 Persistent / Subsurface Dominated (High Persistence)
-----------------------------------
High-Frequency (Short-term) Fit:
  β2 = -0.12
  Interpretation: β ≈ 0: White noise (uncorrelated).
  Persistence: 🔴 Event-driven (Low Persistence)
