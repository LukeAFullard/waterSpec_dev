Automatic Analysis for: Validation Reference
-----------------------------------
Model Comparison (Lower BIC is better):
  - Standard Fit:   BIC = 90.05 (β = -0.37)
  - Segmented Fit:  BIC = 47.73 (β1 = 0.36, β2 = -1.52)

Segmented Analysis for: Validation Reference
Breakpoint Period ≈ 10.3 days
-----------------------------------
Low-Frequency (Long-term) Fit:
  β1 = 0.36
  Interpretation: -0.5 < β < 1 (fGn-like): Weak persistence or anti-persistence, suggesting event-driven transport.
  Persistence: 🔴 Event-driven
-----------------------------------
High-Frequency (Short-term) Fit:
  β2 = -1.52
  Interpretation: Warning: Beta value is significantly negative, which is physically unrealistic.
  Persistence: 🔴 Event-driven
