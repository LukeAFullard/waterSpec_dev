Details for Chosen (Standard) Model:
Standard Analysis for: sub_ls
Value: β = 0.40 (95% CI: 0.39–0.41 (parametric))
Persistence Level: Low (Event-driven)
Scientific Meaning: 0 < β < 1 (fGn-like): Weakly persistent, suggesting event-driven transport.
Contextual Comparison: Similar to E. coli (Surface runoff-dominated).
