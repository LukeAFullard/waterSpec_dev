    "In some advanced cases, a time series may not have a single, uniform scaling behavior across all frequencies. It might, for example, behave like random noise (β ≈ 0) at high frequencies (short timescales) but show strong persistence (β > 1) at low frequencies (long timescales). This indicates a change in the underlying processes governing the system at different scales.\n",
