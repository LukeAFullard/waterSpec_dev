Details for Chosen (Standard) Model:
Standard Analysis for: full_ls
Value: β = 0.84 (95% CI: 0.83–0.85 (parametric))
Persistence Level: Medium (Mixed)
Scientific Meaning: β ≈ 1 (Pink Noise): Stronger persistence, common in natural systems.
Contextual Comparison: Similar to Ortho-P (Surface/Shallow subsurface-dominated).
