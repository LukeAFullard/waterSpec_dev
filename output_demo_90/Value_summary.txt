Automatic Analysis for: Value
-----------------------------------
Model Comparison (Lower BIC is better):
  - Standard        BIC = -5416.14 (β = -0.06)
  - Segmented (1 BP) BIC = -5540.91 (β1=0.07, β2=-0.05)

Segmented Analysis for: Value
Low-Frequency (Long-term) Fit:
  β1 = 0.07 (95% CI: -0.02–0.15 (bootstrap))
  Interpretation: β ≈ 0 (White Noise): Uncorrelated, random process.
  Persistence: Low (Event-driven)
--- Breakpoint 1 @ ~0.0 days (95% CI: 0.0 days–0.0 days (bootstrap)) ---
High-Frequency (Short-term) Fit:
  β2 = -0.05 (95% CI: -0.12–0.04 (bootstrap))
  Interpretation: β ≈ 0 (White Noise): Uncorrelated, random process.
  Persistence: Low (Event-driven)

No significant periodicities were found at the 1.0% FAP level.

Haar Wavelet Analysis:
  β = 1.24
  m = 0.12
  R² = 0.33
  Mean N_eff: 152.9 (of N=10000)
  Persistence: High (Storage-dominated)
  Interpretation: 1 < β < 3.0 (fBm-like): Strong persistence, suggesting transport is damped by storage.
