Changepoint Analysis (Auto Detection)
============================================================

Changepoint Located: 5.2 months
  Segment BEFORE: n=165
  Segment AFTER:  n=335

------------------------------------------------------------

REGIME COMPARISON:
  Before: β ≈ 0.31 (Low (Event-driven))
  After:  β ≈ 0.98 (Medium (Mixed))

  * Significant INCREASE in persistence (+0.67)
    System may have shifted toward more storage-dominated pathways.

============================================================

Automatic Analysis for: Synthetic Segmented Signal (Before 5.2 months)
-----------------------------------
Model Comparison (Lower BIC is better):
  - Standard        BIC = -416.13  (β = 0.31)

  Models that failed to fit:
    - Segmented model (1 breakpoint(s)): Model did not converge.

==> Chosen Model: Standard
-----------------------------------

Details for Chosen (Standard) Model:
Standard Analysis for: Synthetic Segmented Signal (Before 5.2 months)
Value: β = 0.31
Persistence Level: Low (Event-driven)
Scientific Meaning: 0 < β < 1 (fGn-like): Weakly persistent, suggesting event-driven transport.
Contextual Comparison: Similar to E. coli (Surface runoff-dominated).

-----------------------------------
Significant Periodicities Found (at 1.0% FAP Level):
  - Period: 2.2 months

Automatic Analysis for: Synthetic Segmented Signal (After 5.2 months)
-----------------------------------
Model Comparison (Lower BIC is better):
  - Standard        BIC = -945.89  (β = 0.05)
  - Segmented (1 BP) BIC = -1013.84 (β1=0.98, β2=-0.11)

==> Chosen Model: Segmented 1bp
-----------------------------------

Details for Chosen (Segmented 1bp) Model:
Segmented Analysis for: Synthetic Segmented Signal (After 5.2 months)
Low-Frequency (Long-term) Fit:
  β1 = 0.98
  Interpretation: β ≈ 1 (Pink Noise): Stronger persistence, common in natural systems.
  Persistence: Medium (Mixed)
--- Breakpoint 1 @ ~18.7 days ---
High-Frequency (Short-term) Fit:
  β2 = -0.11
  Interpretation: β ≈ 0 (White Noise): Uncorrelated, random process.
  Persistence: Low (Event-driven)

-----------------------------------
Significant Periodicities Found (at 1.0% FAP Level):
  - Period: 7.4 months
