Automatic Analysis for: Nitrate Concentration at Site A
-----------------------------------
Model Comparison (Lower BIC is better):
  - Standard        BIC = 90.05    (β = -0.37)
  - Segmented (1 BP) BIC = 47.73    (β1=0.36, β2=-1.52)

Segmented Analysis for: Nitrate Concentration at Site A
  [Note: Parametric CIs are only available for the first slope and breakpoints.]
Low-Frequency (Long-term) Fit:
  β1 = 0.36 (95% CI: -0.11–0.83 (parametric))
  Interpretation: -0.5 < β < 1 (fGn-like): Weak persistence or anti-persistence, suggesting event-driven transport.
  Persistence: 🔴 Event-driven
--- Breakpoint 1 @ ~10.3 days (95% CI: 14.1 days–7.5 days (parametric)) ---
High-Frequency (Short-term) Fit:
  β2 = -1.52 (95% CI: -1.97–-1.08 (parametric))
  Interpretation: Warning: Beta value is significantly negative, which is physically unrealistic.
  Persistence: 🔴 Event-driven

-----------------------------------
Significant Periodicities Found:
  - Period: 3.0 days (Fit Residual: 4.29)
  - Period: 5.9 days (Fit Residual: 2.51)

-----------------------------------
Uncertainty Report:
  - Warning: The 95% CI for β1 is wide (0.95 > 0.5), suggesting high uncertainty.
  - Warning: The 95% CI for β2 is wide (0.89 > 0.5), suggesting high uncertainty.
