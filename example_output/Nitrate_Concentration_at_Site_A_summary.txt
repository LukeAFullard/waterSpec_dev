Automatic Analysis for: Nitrate Concentration at Site A
-----------------------------------
Model Comparison (Lower BIC is better):
  - Standard        BIC = -108.57  (β = 1.67)
  - Segmented (1 BP) BIC = N/A      (Fit Failed)

  Models that failed to fit:
    - Segmented model (1 breakpoint(s)): No significant breakpoint found (Davies test p-value 0.2798 > 0.05).

==> Chosen Model: Standard
-----------------------------------

Details for Chosen (Standard) Model:
Standard Analysis for: Nitrate Concentration at Site A
Value: β = 1.67 (95% CI: 1.46–1.87 (parametric))
Persistence Level: High (Storage-dominated)
Scientific Meaning: 1 < β < 3.0 (fBm-like): Strong persistence, suggesting transport is damped by storage.
Contextual Comparison: Similar to Chloride (Subsurface-dominated).

No significant periodicities were found at the 1.0% FAP level.
