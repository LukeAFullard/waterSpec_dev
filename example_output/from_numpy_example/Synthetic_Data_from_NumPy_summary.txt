Automatic Analysis for: Synthetic Data from NumPy
-----------------------------------
Model Comparison (Lower BIC is better):
  - Standard        BIC = -453.74  (β = 0.55)
  - Segmented (1 BP) BIC = -478.91  (β1=1.02, β2=-0.44)

Segmented Analysis for: Synthetic Data from NumPy
Low-Frequency (Long-term) Fit:
  β1 = 1.02
  Interpretation: β ≈ 1 (Pink Noise): Stronger persistence, common in natural systems.
  Persistence: High (Storage-dominated)
--- Breakpoint 1 @ ~4.1 days ---
High-Frequency (Short-term) Fit:
  β2 = -0.44
  Interpretation: β < 0 (Anti-persistent): Indicates a mean-reverting process where high values tend to be followed by low values. While this can be a physical phenomenon (e.g., in turbulent flows), it can also indicate over-detrending or aliasing artifacts. Review preprocessing choices.
  Persistence: Low (Event-driven)
