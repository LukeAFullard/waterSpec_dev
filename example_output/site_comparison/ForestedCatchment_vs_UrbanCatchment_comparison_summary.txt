Site Comparison: ForestedCatchment vs. UrbanCatchment
============================================================

  Site 1 (ForestedCatchment): n=50
  Site 2 (UrbanCatchment): n=365

------------------------------------------------------------

SITE COMPARISON:
  ForestedCatchment: β ≈ 1.67 (High (Storage-dominated))
  UrbanCatchment: β ≈ -0.32 (Low (Event-driven))

  * UrbanCatchment shows significantly LOWER persistence than ForestedCatchment (-1.99)

============================================================

Standard Analysis for: Concentration
Value: β = 1.67
Persistence Level: High (Storage-dominated)
Scientific Meaning: 1 < β < 3.0 (fBm-like): Strong persistence, suggesting transport is damped by storage.
Contextual Comparison: Similar to Chloride (Subsurface-dominated).

No significant periodicities were found at the 1.0% FAP level.

============================================================

Segmented Analysis for: Value
Low-Frequency (Long-term) Fit:
  β1 = -0.32
  Interpretation: β < 0 (Anti-persistent): Indicates a mean-reverting process where high values tend to be followed by low values. While this can be a physical phenomenon (e.g., in turbulent flows), it can also indicate over-detrending or aliasing artifacts. Review preprocessing choices.
  Persistence: Low (Event-driven)
--- Breakpoint 1 @ ~33.6 days ---
High-Frequency (Short-term) Fit:
  β2 = 2.34
  Interpretation: 1 < β < 3.0 (fBm-like): Strong persistence, suggesting transport is damped by storage.
  Persistence: High (Storage-dominated)

Significant Periodicities Found (at 1.0% FAP Level):
  - Period: 30.1 days
