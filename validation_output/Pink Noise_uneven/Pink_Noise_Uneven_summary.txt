Automatic Analysis for: Pink Noise (Uneven)
-----------------------------------
Model Comparison (Lower BIC is better):
  - Standard        BIC = -947.26  (β = 0.65)
  - Segmented (1 BP) BIC = N/A      (Fit Failed)

  Models that failed to fit:
    - Segmented model (1 breakpoint(s)): No significant breakpoint found (Davies test p-value 0.4738 > 0.05).

==> Chosen Model: Standard

Details for Chosen (Standard) Model:
Standard Analysis for: Pink Noise (Uneven)
Value: β = 0.65 (95% CI: 0.52–0.80 (bootstrap))
Persistence Level: Medium (Mixed)
Scientific Meaning: 0 < β < 1 (fGn-like): Weakly persistent, suggesting event-driven transport.
Contextual Comparison: Similar to Total Suspended Solids (TSS) (Surface runoff-dominated).
