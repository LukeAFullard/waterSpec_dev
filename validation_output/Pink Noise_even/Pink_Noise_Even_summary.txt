Automatic Analysis for: Pink Noise (Even)
-----------------------------------
Model Comparison (Lower BIC is better):
  - Standard        BIC = -1381.96 (β = 0.98)
  - Segmented (1 BP) BIC = N/A      (Fit Failed)

  Models that failed to fit:
    - Segmented model (1 breakpoint(s)): Model did not converge.

==> Chosen Model: Standard

Details for Chosen (Standard) Model:
Standard Analysis for: Pink Noise (Even)
Value: β = 0.98 (95% CI: 0.85–1.13 (bootstrap))
Persistence Level: Medium (Mixed)
Scientific Meaning: β ≈ 1 (Pink Noise): Stronger persistence, common in natural systems.
Contextual Comparison: Similar to Ortho-P (Surface/Shallow subsurface-dominated).
