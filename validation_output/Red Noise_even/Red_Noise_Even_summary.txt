Automatic Analysis for: Red Noise (Even)
-----------------------------------
Model Comparison (Lower BIC is better):
  - Standard        BIC = -1455.63 (β = 1.85)
  - Segmented (1 BP) BIC = N/A      (Fit Failed)

  Models that failed to fit:
    - Segmented model (1 breakpoint(s)): No significant breakpoint found (Davies test p-value 0.0945 > 0.05).

==> Chosen Model: Standard
