Automatic Analysis for: White Noise (Uneven)
-----------------------------------
Model Comparison (Lower BIC is better):
  - Standard        BIC = -832.37  (β = 0.00)
  - Segmented (1 BP) BIC = N/A      (Fit Failed)

  Models that failed to fit:
    - Segmented model (1 breakpoint(s)): No significant breakpoint found (Davies test p-value 0.0894 > 0.05).

==> Chosen Model: Standard

Details for Chosen (Standard) Model:
Standard Analysis for: White Noise (Uneven)
Value: β = 0.00 (95% CI: -0.17–0.18 (bootstrap))
Persistence Level: Low (Event-driven)
Scientific Meaning: β ≈ 0 (White Noise): Uncorrelated, random process.
Contextual Comparison: Closest to E. coli (Surface runoff-dominated).

No significant periodicities were found at the 1.0% FAP level.
