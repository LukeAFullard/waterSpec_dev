Automatic Analysis for: White Noise (Even)
-----------------------------------
Model Comparison (Lower BIC is better):
  - Standard        BIC = -1407.05 (β = -0.01)

==> Chosen Model: Standard
-----------------------------------

Details for Chosen (Standard) Model:
Standard Analysis for: White Noise (Even)
Value: β = -0.01 (95% CI: -0.12–0.13 (bootstrap))
Persistence Level: Low (Event-driven)
Scientific Meaning: β ≈ 0 (White Noise): Uncorrelated, random process.
Contextual Comparison: Closest to E. coli (Surface runoff-dominated).
