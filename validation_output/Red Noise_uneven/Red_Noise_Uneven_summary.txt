Details for Chosen (Standard) Model:
Standard Analysis for: Red Noise (Uneven)
Value: β = 0.54 (95% CI: 0.27–0.74 (bootstrap))
Persistence Level: Medium (Mixed)
Scientific Meaning: 0 < β < 1 (fGn-like): Weakly persistent, suggesting event-driven transport.
Contextual Comparison: Similar to Total Suspended Solids (TSS) (Surface runoff-dominated).
